At a trolleybus stop, there are N passengers waiting to board, including Vanja and Peter. Vanja buys a ticket first, and when Peter glances at it, he notices the ticket number is a prime. Peter decides he also wants a ticket with a prime number. The tickets are issued sequentially, starting from the number on Vanja’s ticket, and there is only one roll of tickets with consecutive numbers.

If the roll runs out before Peter gets a prime-numbered ticket, he’ll have to "stow away," meaning he'll ride without a ticket and face the risk of getting caught.

Input
The input consists of two numbers: the number of passengers, N, and the starting ticket number on Vanja’s ticket. The ticket number has up to 6 digits.

Output
Output the number of passengers Peter would need to let buy tickets ahead of him to get a prime-numbered ticket. If it's impossible for Peter to get a prime-numbered ticket before the roll ends, output −1.
